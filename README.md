# CodeX-Beverage-Analysis

CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India.

Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents. Peter Pandey, a marketing data analyst is tasked to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.

Below I am sharing my analytical dashboard that I created.
